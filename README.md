## Introudction
- SFU CMPT 459: Data Mining, Group Project: Prediction of The Outcome of A COVID-19 Patient.
- The data mining task will be to predict the outcome of a case. 
- In the first milestone of the course project, the aim is to do the data preprocessing as specified further in the document.
- In the second and third milestones, the aim is to build models and using this model to predict the outcomes on
cases_test.csv dataset. 
- The performance of these models will be evaluated based on the predictions on the test set, and hence it is important to treat cases_test.csv and cases_train.csv similarly.
- The professor is Dr. Martin Ester.
- The group members are Zeyong Jin (zeyongj@sfu.ca), Yuqing Wu (ywa292@sfu.ca) and Zixi Bai (zixib@sfu.ca).

This repository is ONLY for backup. Students should NEVER use this repository to finish their works, IN ANY WAY.

It is expected that within this course, the highest standards of academic integrity will be maintained, in
keeping with SFU’s Policy S10.01, `Code of Academic Integrity and Good Conduct`.

In this class, collaboration is encouraged for in-class exercises and the team components of the assignments, as well
as task preparation for group discussions. However, individual work should be completed by the person
who submits it. Any work that is independent work of the submitter should be clearly cited to make its
source clear. All referenced work in reports and presentations must be appropriately cited, to include
websites, as well as figures and graphs in presentations. If there are any questions whatsoever, feel free
to contact the course instructor about any possible grey areas.

Some examples of unacceptable behaviour:
- Handing in assignments/exercises that are not 100% your own work (in design, implementation,
wording, etc.), without a clear/visible citation of the source.
- Using another student's work as a template or reference for completing your own work.
- Using any unpermitted resources during an exam.
- Looking at, or attempting to look at, another student's answer during an exam.
- Submitting work that has been submitted before, for any course at any institution.

All instances of academic dishonesty will be dealt with severely and according to SFU policy. This means
that Student Services will be notified, and they will record the dishonesty in the student's file. Students
are strongly encouraged to review SFU’s Code of Academic Integrity and Good Conduct (S10.01) available
online at: http://www.sfu.ca/policies/gazette/student/s10-01.html.
