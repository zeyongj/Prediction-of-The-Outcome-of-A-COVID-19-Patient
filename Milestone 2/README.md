This is the second milestone of the course project of CMPT 459 E100: Data Mining, finished by Yuqing Wu, Zeyong Jin and Zixi Bai. And the professor is Dr. Martin Ester.

During our research before the coding, we are inspired by the following articles:

In order to to execute the codes, the following libraries are needed:
numpy
pandas
sklearn
warnings
seaborn
datetime
lightgbm
math
pickle

Please check the following guides to run the codes:
1. If using main.py, then just command: python src/main.py
2. If using main.ipynb: 
	First you need to create new data, plots and models folders respectively in the left file bar. 
	Then you need to manually upload case_train_processed.csv to the data folder and lgb_classifier.pkl, mlp_classifier.pkl and svc_classifier.pkl into models folder.
	And now you can just click the run button one by one to run it.

Thanks!
